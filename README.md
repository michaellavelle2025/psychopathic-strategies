# Further Research Directions

There are several strategies listed above which do not have corresponding tactics explicity specified within the 25 tactics from Dr Mitchell's thesis - although some are referenced as part of the wider thesis text.

## Relating to the target:

### * Silences the target

### * Usurps the target

## Relating to more generic psychopathic aims:

### * Destroys, annihilates or targets - disguising the behaviour as something positive

### * Publicises effective techniques of achieving destruction or targeting, disguised as ways to repair what is being destroyed or to protect those being targeted
